The GIT repository contains a definition of the Factoid Prosopography Ontology (FPO).

It has been created by John Bradley (john.bradley@kcl.ac.uk).
It is described at http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk

The version of FPO presented here is a preliminary construct, and would benefit from
further work.  Watch this space for newer versions.
